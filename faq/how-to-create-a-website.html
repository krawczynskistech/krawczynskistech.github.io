                <h1 class="question">How to create a website?</h1>
                <p class="answer">Many people have a problem figuring out how to make or get a website. You’re not alone and we’re here to help you answer this question.</p>
                <h2 class="subfaq">Making a website by yourself</h2>
                <p class="answer">To make a website by yourself you need to learn a programming language called HTML (HyperText Markup Language) ,that will let you create a basic web page. In this language you write the basic structure of the page. And the main page is called index.html. But knowing only HTML is pretty much useless. To add style to your page you have to learn CSS (Cascade Style Sheet), without this your webpage will be ugly. To add functionality to your website, you will need to learn Javascript. To make more complex web services, you will need to learn a backend language like node.js or PHP. If you write your code and learn all the things, then you need to find a hosting platform that will let you publish these pages. For ex. Github. As you can see, it’s a lot of hard work, so you probably don’t want to do it by yourself.</p>
                <h2 class="subfaq">How to get a website without learning all of this stuff?</h2>
                <p class="answer">If you want to get a website without learning a lot of things, then the best option is to contact a web development company. They will make your webpage with full customization, and you won’t need any knowledge to obtain such a website. A lot of web devs charge a lot of money for their services.
