                <h1 class="question">How much a website costs?</h1>
                <p class="answer">Many people / businesses want to have a website, this article will tell you about the costs of a website, and how to get a good website for a low prize.</p>
                <h2 class="subfaq">Prizes and how to get a website for a good prize.</h2>
                <p class="answer">There are many companies that sell websites for you or your business. But the costs are usually very big. By very big I mean thousands of dollars. Usually the prizes are from 1000$ to 10 000$. It depends how complex your webpage is going to be. Static landing pages are cheaper than dynamic webpages with databases.  Not every company has so high costs though. Krawczynski’s Tech offers high quality websites for a fairly cheap prize, because we love coding, and want to make such services accesible for everyone. <a href="https://krawczynskistech.github.io/prizing.html">Click here to go to Krawczynski’s Tech prizing page</a>.</p>
