                <h2 class="subfaq">Worse advertisment with website builders</h2>
                <p class="answer">If you don’t know anything about web development, building a website with a builder is not a good idea. These builder sites may look stunning, but they usually work bad with alghoritms. These algoritms are very important, because they make your website apppear on Google, and other search engines.

                <h2 class="subfaq">Website builders lacking customizability</h2>
                <p class="answer">Website builders, are restrictive, and not as much customizable. However letting a company build a website for you , will match your preferences, and personalize the website to your needs.
