                <h1 class="question">Should I make a personal website?</h1>
                <p class="answer">Many people have a hard time deciding about making a personal website. You’re not alone, and we are here to help you make the decision. </p>
                <h2 class="subfaq">Social media / Boosting your recognizability</h2>
                <p class="answer"> A website is good if you want to get more clients or boost your recognizability. If you want to get more followers on social media ,and be generally better recognizable , then a website might be the right thing for you.</p>
                <h2 class="subfaq">Applying for a job - Addition to CV / Resume</h2>
                <p class="answer">A website is a great idea if you are applying for a Job. It can be a really good addition to your CV/Resume. It will make a unique first impression for the employer, and will increase  your chances of landing your Job. You will stand out among the other people that only have a CV/Resume.</p>
                <h2 class="subfaq">For buisnesses</h2>
                <p class="answer">If you have a business, a website is a must-have. It’s really good for catching clients. It’s like a worldwide ad that will interest some customers, if it’s properly done.</p>
                <h2 class="subfaq">What if i don't have a buisness/social media/ i'm not applying for a job</h2>
                <p class="answer">If you don’t have a business, don’t want to gain clients or recognizability, don’t want to stand out while applying to a Job, or don’t want to boost your social media, then a website will probably change nothing for you, so I don’t recommend buying it.</p>
                <h2 class="subfaq">Where to buy a website?</h2>
